A GH action for validating version tag sequences and ensuring compliance with versioning standards in repositories.

## Motivation

This action is designed to help maintainers and contributors ensure that version tags are sequenced correctly and comply with versioning standards. It can be used to prevent common issues such as:
- Duplicate version tags on input
- Missing version tags
- Incorrect version sequences
- Non-standard version formats

**Action provides two possible regimes (based on `should-exist` flag):**
- check that the version tag is an increment of an exiting one (`should-exist=false`, default)
- check that the version tag is present in the repository (`should-exist=true`)

## Requirements
- **GitHub Token**: A GitHub token with permission to fetch repository data such as Issues and Pull Requests.
- **Python 3.11+**: Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system.

## Inputs

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- **Description**: Your GitHub token for authentication. Store it as a secret and reference it in the workflow file as secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN.
- **Required**: Yes

### `github-repository`
- **Description**: The GitHub repository to check for version tags. Example: `AbsaOSS/version-tag-check`.
- **Required**: Yes

### `version-tag`
- **Description**: The version tag to check for in the repository. Example: `v0.1.0`.
- **Required**: Yes

### `should-exist`
- **Description**: Flag to indicate if the version tag should exist in the repository. Set to `true` to check if the version tag should exist. Setting to `true` disables increment validity check. 
- **Default**: `false`
- **Required**: No

### Behavior Summary

Depending on the combination of these inputs, the action behaves slightly differently. 
The action checks
- **1st check:** checks the received tag format (semantic version prefixed by a `v`)
- **2nd check:** checks tag presence in the target git repository
  - _Note:_ `should-exist` flag determines the expected presence of the tag in the repository
- **3rd check:** checks if the tag version is a valid increment of a previous version 
   - _Note:_ This check is *not executed** when `should-exist` is set to `true`. 

| Tag present in repository (2nd check) | Expected presence of tag in repository | Increment Validity Check (3rd check) | Action final state                                                             |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Yes**                               | `true`                                 | Skipped                              | ‚úÖ **Success**: The version tag exists as expected.                              |
| **No**                                | `true`                                 | Skipped                              | ‚ùå **Failure**: The version tag does not exist in the repository.                |
| **Yes**                               | `false`                                | Skipped                              | ‚ùå **Failure**: The version tag should not exist but does.                       |
| **No**                                | `false`                                | Performed                            | ‚úÖ **Success**: The version tag does not exist and is a valid increment.         |
| **No**                                | `false`                                | Performed                            | ‚ùå **Failure**: The version tag does not exist and is **not** a valid increment. |

## Usage

### Adding the Action to Your Workflow

See the default action step definition:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5.1.1
  with:
    python-version: '3.11'

- name: Version Tag Check
  id: version_tag_check
  uses: AbsaOSS/version-tag-check@v0.1.0
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  
  with:
    github-repository: "{ org }/{ repo }"   # e.g. ${{ github.repository }}
    version-tag: "v0.1.0"
    should-exist: "false"
```

- `v1.0.0-ALPHA` < `v1.0.0-BETA`

## Running Static Code Analysis

This project uses Pylint tool for static code analysis. Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces, coding standards, looks for code smells etc.

Pylint displays a global evaluation score for the code, rated out of a maximum score of 10.0. We are aiming to keep our code quality high above the score 9.5.

### Set Up Python Environment
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will also install a Pylint tool, since it is listed in the project requirements.

### Run Pylint
Run Pylint on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.
```shell
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Pylint on a specific file, follow the pattern `pylint <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:
```shell
pylint ./version_tag_check/version_tag_check_action.py
``` 

## Run Black Tool Locally
This project uses the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) tool for code formatting.
Black aims for consistency, generality, readability and reducing git diffs.
The coding style used can be viewed as a strict subset of PEP 8.

The project root file `pyproject.toml` defines the Black tool configuration.
In this project we are accepting the line length of 120 characters.

Follow these steps to format your code with Black locally:

### Set Up Python Environment
From terminal in the root of the project, run the following command:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will also install a Black tool, since it is listed in the project requirements.

### Run Black
Run Black on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.
```shell
black $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Black on a specific file, follow the pattern `black <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:
```shell
black ./version_tag_check/version_tag_check_action.py
``` 

### Expected Output
This is the console expected output example after running the tool:
```
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted.
```

## Run mypy Tool Locally

This project uses the [my[py]](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
tool which is a static type checker for Python.

> Type checkers help ensure that you‚Äôre using variables and functions in your code correctly.
> With mypy, add type hints (PEP 484) to your Python programs,
> and mypy will warn you when you use those types incorrectly.
my[py] configuration is in `pyptoject.toml` file.

Follow these steps to format your code with my[py] locally:

### Run my[py]

Run my[py] on all files in the project.
```shell
  mypy .
```

To run my[py] check on a specific file, follow the pattern `mypy <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py --check-untyped-defs`.

Example:
```shell
   mypy living_documentation_regime/living_documentation_generator.py
``` 

### Expected Output

This is the console expected output example after running the tool:
```
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

## Running Unit Test

Unit tests are written using pytest. To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
pytest tests/
```

This will execute all tests located in the tests directory.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is collected using pytest-cov coverage tool. To run the tests and collect coverage information, use the following command:

```shell
pytest --cov=. -v tests/ --cov-fail-under=80
```

This will execute all tests located in the tests directory and generate a code coverage report.

See the coverage report on the path:

```shell
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Run Action Locally
Create *.sh file and place it in the project root.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure that Python virtual environment is activated
if [ ! -d ".venv" ]; then
  echo "Python virtual environment not found. Creating one..."
  python3 -m venv .venv
fi

source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check if GITHUB_TOKEN is set
if [ -z "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "Error: GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is not set."
  exit 1
fi

# Set necessary environment variables
export INPUT_GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_TOKEN"
export INPUT_VERSION_TAG="v1.2.3"
export INPUT_GITHUB_REPOSITORY="AbsaOSS/generate-release-notes"

# Run the main script
python main.py
```
